# searchlib

Principles:
- Try to design the API 'pythonic'
- Use mainly function arguments
- Allow the user to use any kind of costs (not necessarily floats), with the only prerequisite being that all returned costs/heuristics can be compared with operands like `==` and `>`

## Installation
`pip3 install git+git://github.com/ctittel/searchlib`
